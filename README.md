This is a solution for the [Kiwi Deep Learning Challenge]() that was made on 2017. I'm currently learning about Machine Learning and I thought this was a fun little project to start, even if the challenge finished about 3 years ago :D.

The cli usage instructions can be found in the challenge link. You can find some trained models on the `models` folder, but you can retrain them by calling `python app.py -m <model_name> -d images/train/`. The three models available are:
- logistic
- tensorflow
- lenet
